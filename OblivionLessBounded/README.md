## Oblivion Less Bound
Oblivion Less Bound is a new start mod with a focus on randomization and player choice.

## Why?
Existing new start mods are very static.
All the player choices aren't dynamic, if you choose that you start in X location, you'll also get Y items.
I am not a fan of them.
While they're fun for a couple starts, the choices aren't very interesting.

You're also forced into one option to start the main quest, and not a fun one to boot.
My mod adds more options to make the game better fit for any kind of player.
