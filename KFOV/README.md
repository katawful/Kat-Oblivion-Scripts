# Kat's Fantastic Oblivion Viewport
This is a FOV and screenshot mod that is fast, reliable, feature-packed, and most importantly: simple.
There's little configuration if you just want FOV adjustment, but if you want the screenshot functionality you can configure it with the builtin INI file or through Maskar's excellent [LINK](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/50144) mod configuration menu.

# Features
* FOV control through console and hotkeys
* Weather cylcling for supported mods (All Natural and Nehrim currently not supported)
* INI and LINK support for all features
* Instant loading, no more pop-in
* Separate 1st person and 3rd person FOV
